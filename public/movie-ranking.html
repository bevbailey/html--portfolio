<h3> Talk To Me</h3>
<p> This movie was not only a wild ride but scary as well. The ending will leave you thinking about the movie for weeks. 10/10.</p>

<h3>Wakanda Forever</h3>
<p>Emotional and inspiring. Hate to love characters, scifi and world building were great. RIP Chad.</p>

<h3>The Harder They Fall</h3>
<p>Based on real life people. Wild Wild West with a little comedy. Great story.</p>

<h3>Creed 3</h3>
<p> Michael B. Jordan is good at anything he acts in honestly. This story follows Adonis and his family as he deals with a different set of problems that comes with fame and having a family. Highly recommend this movie.</p>
