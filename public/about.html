<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Beverly. Everyone calls me Bev for short. I am currently in the process of becoming a full stack developer and programmer. I am currently making a career switch from being a paramedic for 7 years. I enjoy being outdoors, music, reading and gaming. My love for computers, programming and gaming was cut short in my teenage years due to having to work more. I am currently picking it back up and loving every minute of it. I love coding because you can literally make something out of nothing. The thought of taking two things I love ,creating and coding, and putting them together excites me. I am a hard worker, often worked two to three jobs at a time. I'm very detailed oriented and like to think out of the box for efficency sake. Visit my contact me page if you have any questions.</p>
